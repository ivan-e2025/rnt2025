# RenewTrust 
RenewTrust uses AI and blockchain technology to support the trade of hourly renewable energy certificates (RECs) that are traceable, unique, and offer liquidity as they are tokenized as NFTs. 

The traceability allows tracking the life cycle of RECs (i.e. when and how the RECs are generated as well as how they are used and by whom). Likewise, the RenewTrust RECs are unique as they capture special features associated with how (i.e. which energy sources are used), when (at which hour) and where they are generated, which defines what their value should be. Finally, the RenewTrust RECs offer liquidity as they can be traded on an hourly basis and not yearly like other certificates.
